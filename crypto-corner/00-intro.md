## Steganography

Steganography is the hiding of a message by a physical means. An example of steganography would be hiding a message in an image file's bytes.

## Cryptography

Cryptography is split into two ways of changing the message systematically to confuse anyone who intercepts it: these are codes and ciphers. Many people believe, and use, the word code to mean the same thing as cipher, but technically they are different.

!!!primary Code
Codes are ways of changing messages by replacing each word with another word that has a different meaning.
!!!

!!!primary Cipher
Ciphers convert messages by a rule, known only to the sender and recipient, which changes each individual letter (or sometimes groups of letters)
!!!

## Conventions
* **plaintext** = the message that is being encrypted
* **ciphertext** = the encrypted message
* **alphabet** = letters and symbols which will be transformed by the cipher
